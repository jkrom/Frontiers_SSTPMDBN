The code in this repository can be used to simulated coordinated reset stimulation in networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Simulation results are presented in the following manuscript:

Kromer, J.A. and Tass, P.A. (2024), Coordinated reset stimulation of plastic neural networks with
spatially dependent synaptic connections. _Frontiers in Network Physiology_ 4:1351815. doi: 10.3389/fnetp.2024.1351815

To reproduce the simulation results in the manuscirpt run _main.ipynb_.

Parts of the code overlap with the code published by the same authors in the repositories
