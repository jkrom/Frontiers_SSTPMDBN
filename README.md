# Frontiers_SSTPMDBN

The code in this repository can be used to simulated coordinated reset stimulation in networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Simulation results are presented in the following manuscript:

Kromer, J.A. and Tass, P.A. (2024) _Coordinated Reset Stimulation of Plastic
Neural Networks with Spatially Dependent Synaptic Connections_. Manuscript submitted for publication.
(reference will be updated after publication)

To reproduce the simulation results in the manuscirpt run _main.ipynb_.

Parts of the code overlap with the code published by the same authors in the repositories
